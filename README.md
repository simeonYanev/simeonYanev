# Hello, I'm Simeon Yanev! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me 
- I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer. Over the last years, I've gained experience working on various projects and have developed a strong set of skills that I'm excited to put to use. 
- My goal is to become a member of a Professional Web Development Team in which I will be able to improve my current skills and acquire new ones. 
- If I could say only one sentence about myself, it would be that I'm the type of person who doesn't know or can do everything, but is extremely hardworking, passionate and dedicated to learning and finding the best solutions!
